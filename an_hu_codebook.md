**Version:** 2025-08-29 for code_set_historical_unity - **(559 coded segments; historical_unity=371, address=389; including doubled codes)**



## Purpose
This dataset records coded segments of an analysis of Vladimir Putin's' **On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukranians** and his **televised Address of 21 February 2022**.

## Unit of Categorisation
A **coded segment**: a text segment or fragment assigned to a specific code during a *Critical Discourse Analysis* denoting how a certain narrative is constructed

## Columns
- **document_name** *(categorical)* - Denotes the two sources, either:
    - `historical_unity` - **Putin, V. (2021). On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians**
    - `address` - **Putin, V. (2022, February). Address by the President of the Russian Federation**
- **code** *(categorical)* - The codes used in MAXQDA:
    - `pro` - **Benevolent Protector and Moral Authority**
    - `del` - **Deligitimisation of Ukrainian Sovereignty**
    - `esc` - **Escalation to Intervention**
    - `his` - **Historical Entitlement**
    - `tcs` - **Threat Framing with subcode: Threat or Crisis Situation**
    - `tvw` - **Threat Framing with subcode: Vilification of Western Encroachment**
    - `uni` - **Unity and Kinship of Russians and Ukranians**
- **segment** *(string)* - The individual coded segments depeding on document and code (e.g. sow discord among people; a stable statehood has never developed in Ukraine)

## Reliability Notes
Each segment is assigned to its primary source. The project components were directly exported from the MAXQDA project. The data was then annotated for usability.
