Historical_unity;Uni;Russians and Ukrainians were one people – a single whole
Historical_unity;Pro;the wall that has emerged in recent ​years between Russia and Ukraine, between the parts of what is essentially ​the same historical and spiritual space, to my mind is our great common ​misfortune and tragedy.
Historical_unity;Uni;between the parts of what is essentially ​the same historical and spiritual space
Historical_unity;Pro;These are, first and foremost, the consequences of our ​own mistakes made at different periods of time.

Historical_unity;His;The throne of Kiev held a dominant position in Ancient Rus
Historical_unity;His;custom since the late 9th century
Historical_unity;His;the words of Oleg the Prophet about Kiev, ”Let it be the mother of all ​Russian cities
Historical_unity;Uni;both the nobility ​and the common people perceived Rus as a common territory, as their ​homeland
Historical_unity;Uni;our shared history, reflecting its complex ​and multi-dimensional nature
Historical_unity;Uni;people both in the western and eastern Russian lands spoke ​the same language
Historical_unity;Uni;Their faith was Orthodox
Historical_unity;Uni;Up to the middle ​of the 15th century, the unified church government remained in place
Historical_unity;His;At a new stage of historical development, both Lithuanian Rus and Moscow Rus ​could have become the points of attraction and consolidation of the territories ​of Ancient Rus
Historical_unity;His;It so happened that Moscow became the center of reunification, ​continuing the tradition of ancient Russian statehood
Historical_unity;Pro;Moscow princes – ​the descendants of Prince Alexander Nevsky – cast off the foreign yoke ​and began gathering the Russian lands
Historical_unity;Pro;the liberation movement ​of the Orthodox population was gaining strength in the Dnieper region

Historical_unity;His;take them under patronage
Historical_unity;His;the ambassadors of Bohdan ​Khmelnytsky and Moscow visited dozens of cities, including Kiev, whose ​populations swore allegiance to the Russian tsar.

Historical_unity;Uni;the Cossacks ​referred to and defined themselves as Russian Orthodox people
Historical_unity;His;The Russian state ​incorporated the city of Kiev and the lands on the left bank of the Dnieper River, ​including Poltava region, Chernigov region, and Zaporozhye
Historical_unity;Uni;Their inhabitants ​were reunited with the main part of the Russian Orthodox people
Historical_unity;His;These ​territories were referred to as ”Malorossia“ (Little Russia)
Historical_unity;His;The name ”Ukraine“ was used more often in the meaning of the Old Russian ​word ”okraina“ (periphery)
Historical_unity;Del;the word ”Ukrainian“, ​judging by archival documents, originally referred to frontier guards who ​protected the external borders
Historical_unity;Pro;under the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, ​the old orders were restored, and social and religious oppression intensified
Historical_unity;Pro;the lands on the left bank, taken under the protection ​of the unified state, saw rapid development
Historical_unity;Uni;people who ​spoke the same language and had the same faith
Historical_unity;Uni;people in Malorossia were not ​faced with a choice of whom to side with
Historical_unity;Uni;People of all orders and degrees considered ​themselves Russian and Orthodox
Historical_unity;Uni;Cossack senior officers belonging to the nobility would reach the heights ​of political, diplomatic, and military careers in Russia
Historical_unity;Uni;Graduates of Kiev-Mohyla ​Academy played a leading role in church life
Historical_unity;Uni;Malorussians in many ways ​helped build a big common country – its statehood, culture, and science
Historical_unity;Uni;during the Soviet period, natives ​of Ukraine held major, including the highest, posts in the leadership of the unified ​state
Historical_unity;Uni;Nikita Khrushchev and Leonid Brezhnev, whose party ​biography was most closely associated with Ukraine, led the Communist Party ​of the Soviet Union (CPSU) for almost 30 years

Historical_unity;His;The incorporation of the western Russian lands into the single state was not ​merely the result of political and diplomatic decisions
Historical_unity;Uni;common faith, shared cultural traditions
Historical_unity;Uni;language similarity
Historical_unity;Uni;as early as the beginning ​of the 17th century, one of the hierarchs of the Uniate Church, Joseph Rutsky, ​communicated to Rome that people in Moscovia called Russians from ​the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth their brothers, that their written language ​was absolutely identical, and differences in the vernacular were insignificant
Historical_unity;Del;Many centuries of fragmentation and living within different states naturally ​brought about regional language peculiarities, resulting in the emergence ​of dialects
Historical_unity;Uni;Their works ​are our common literary and cultural heritage.
Historical_unity;Uni;Taras Shevchenko wrote poetry ​in the Ukrainian language, and prose mainly in Russian.
Historical_unity;Uni;The books of Nikolay ​Gogol, a Russian patriot and native of Poltavshchyna, are written in Russian, ​bristling with Malorussian folk sayings and motifs
Historical_unity;Uni;How can this heritage be ​divided between Russia and Ukraine?
Historical_unity;Uni;The south-western lands of the Russian Empire, Malorussia and Novorossiya, ​and the Crimea developed as ethnically and religiously diverse entities. Crimean ​Tatars, Armenians, Greeks, Jews, Karaites, Krymchaks, Bulgarians, Poles, Serbs, ​Germans, and other peoples lived here. They all preserved their faith, traditions, ​and customs.
Historical_unity;Pro;I am not going to idealise anything
Historical_unity;His;it is important to be mindful of the historical context
Historical_unity;Uni;There is objective ​evidence that the Russian Empire was witnessing an active process ​of development of the Malorussian cultural identity within the greater Russian ​nation, which united the Velikorussians, the Malorussians and the Belorussians
Historical_unity;Del;the idea of Ukrainian people as a nation separate from ​the Russians started to form
Historical_unity;His;there was no historical basis
Historical_unity;His;it declared the creation of the Ukrainian People's Republic ​(UPR) as part of Russia
Historical_unity;Del;the Central Rada proclaimed ​Ukraine independent in its Fourth Universal
Historical_unity;Del;The declared sovereignty did not last long
Historical_unity;Pro;pretext for occupation
Historical_unity;His;Ukraine is to take the lead ​in the formation of an All-Russian Federation
Historical_unity;Pro;Symon Petliura (portrayed as one of the ”heroes“ in today's ​Ukraine) concluded secret conventions on behalf of the UPR Directorate, giving ​up – in exchange for military support – Galicia and Western Volhynia lands ​to Poland
Historical_unity;His;quasi-state formations that ​emerged across the former Russian Empire at the time of the Civil War ​and turbulence were inherently unstable
Historical_unity;Pro;Lenin insisted ​that they act as part of Soviet Ukraine
Historical_unity;Pro;one government for all of Ukraine
Historical_unity;His;the western lands of the former Russian Empire ​were ceded to Poland
Historical_unity;Pro;The areas were subjected to harsh ​Polonisation, local culture and traditions suppressed

Historical_unity;His;when the USSR was created, with the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist ​Republic becoming one of its founders
Historical_unity;Uni;Lenin's plan to form ​a union state as a federation of equal republics
Historical_unity;Del;parade ​of sovereignties
Historical_unity;Del;a rather fierce debate among ​the Bolshevik leaders resulted in the implementation of Lenin's plan to form ​a union state as a federation of equal republics
Historical_unity;Del;The right for the republics ​to freely secede from the Union was included in the text of the Declaration ​on the Creation of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics
Historical_unity;Del;By doing so, the authors planted ​in the foundation of our statehood the most dangerous time bomb, which ​exploded the moment the safety mechanism provided by the leading role ​of the CPSU was gone, the party itself collapsing from within
Historical_unity;Del;the USSR as a subject of international law and a geopolitical ​reality no longer existed
Historical_unity;Del;Ukraine never signed or ratified the CIS ​Charter adopted back in 1993
Historical_unity;Del;localization policy
Historical_unity;Del;ideologists of Ukrainian ​nationalism
Historical_unity;Del;The localization policy undoubtedly played a major role in the development ​and consolidation of the Ukrainian culture, language and identity
Historical_unity;Del;under the guise of combating the so-called Russian great-power ​chauvinism, Ukrainization was often imposed on those who did not see ​themselves as Ukrainians
Historical_unity;Del;Soviet national policy secured at the state level ​the provision on three separate Slavic peoples: Russian, Ukrainian ​and Belorussian, instead of the large Russian nation, a triune people comprising ​Velikorussians, Malorussians and Belorussians
Historical_unity;Uni;Russian, Ukrainian ​and Belorussian, instead of the large Russian nation,
Historical_unity;His;In 1954, the Crimean Region ​of the RSFSR was given to the Ukrainian SSR, in gross violation of legal norms ​that were in force at the time
Historical_unity;His;In 1948, Zmeyiniy Island (Snake Island) ​in the Black Sea became part of Ukraine
Historical_unity;His;the destiny of Carpathian Ruthenia, which became part ​of Czechoslovakia following the breakup of Austria-Hungary
Historical_unity;His;Rusins made up ​a considerable share of local population
Historical_unity;His;the congress ​of the Orthodox population of the region voted for the inclusion of Carpathian ​Ruthenia in the RSFSR or, as a separate Carpathian republic, in the USSR proper
Historical_unity;Pro;the choice of people was ignored
Historical_unity;His;the historical act ​of the reunification of Carpathian Ukraine ”with its ancient motherland, ​Ukraine“ – as The Pravda newspaper put it – was announced
Historical_unity;Del;modern Ukraine is entirely the product of the Soviet era
Historical_unity;Del;it was shaped – for a significant part – on the lands ​of historical Russia
Historical_unity;His;it is enough to look at the boundaries ​of the lands reunited with the Russian state in the 17th century and the territory ​of the Ukrainian SSR when it left the Soviet Union
Historical_unity;Pro;The Bolsheviks treated the Russian people as inexhaustible material for their ​social experiments
Historical_unity;Pro;They dreamt of a world revolution that would wipe out ​national states
Historical_unity;Del;territorial gifts
Historical_unity;Del;It is no longer important what exactly the idea ​of the Bolshevik leaders who were chopping the country into pieces was
Historical_unity;Pro;We can ​disagree about minor details, background and logics behind certain decisions
Historical_unity;His;One fact is crystal clear: Russia was robbed, indeed
Historical_unity;Del;Russia was robbed
Historical_unity;Pro;When working on this article, I relied on open-source documents that contain ​well-known facts rather than on some secret records
Historical_unity;Pro;The leaders of modern ​Ukraine and their external ”patrons“ prefer to overlook these facts
Historical_unity;Pro;They do not ​miss a chance, however, both inside the country and abroad, to condemn ” ​the crimes of the Soviet regime
Historical_unity;Pro;listing among them events with which neither ​the CPSU, nor the USSR, let alone modern Russia, have anything to do
Historical_unity;His;Bolsheviks' efforts to detach from Russia its historical ​territories are not considered a crime
Historical_unity;Del;inside the USSR, borders between republics were never seen as state ​borders
Historical_unity;Uni;they were nominal within a single country
Historical_unity;Del;while featuring all ​the attributes of a federation, was highly centralized
Historical_unity;His;people, found themselves abroad overnight, taken away, this time ​indeed, from their historical motherland
Historical_unity;Pro;some part of a people in the process of its development, ​influenced by a number of reasons and historical circumstances, can become ​aware of itself as a separate nation at a certain moment
Historical_unity;Pro;with respect
Historical_unity;Pro;You want to establish a state of your own: you are welcome!
Historical_unity;Del;every decision must be legitimate
Historical_unity;Del;the republics that were founders of the Union, ​having denounced the 1922 Union Treaty, must return to the boundaries they ​had had before joining the Soviet Union
Historical_unity;Del;other territorial acquisitions are ​subject to discussion, negotiations, given that the ground has been revoked
Historical_unity;Del;when you leave, take what you brought with you
Historical_unity;Pro;in disregard of people's views
Historical_unity;Pro;The Russian Federation recognized the new geopolitical realities: and not only ​recognized, but, indeed, did a lot for Ukraine to establish itself as an independent ​country
Historical_unity;Pro;we have ​provided considerable support to Ukraine
Historical_unity;Pro;If economic ties between our ​countries had been retained, Ukraine would enjoy the benefit of tens of billions ​of dollars
Historical_unity;Uni;Ukraine and Russia have developed as a single economic system over decades ​and centuries

Historical_unity;Pro;an example ​for the European Union to look up to
Historical_unity;Uni;natural complementary economic ​partners
Historical_unity;Pro;strengthen competitive advantages, ​increasing the potential of both countries
Historical_unity;Pro;Ukraine used to possess great potential
Historical_unity;Pro;Who is to blame for this?
Historical_unity;Pro;Is it the people of Ukraine's fault?
Historical_unity;Pro;The feelings of millions of people ​who treat Russia not just well but with great affection, just as we feel about ​Ukraine, remain the same
Historical_unity;Pro;They brought tangible benefits ​to people – both in Russia and Ukraine.
Historical_unity;Pro;that is why we had a fruitful interaction with all, I emphasize, with ​all the leaders of Ukraine
Historical_unity;Pro;I charged the Russian government ​to elaborate options for preserving and maintaining our economic ties
Historical_unity;Pro;there was and is still no mutual will ​to do the same
Historical_unity;Pro;Russia is still one of Ukraine's top three trading
Historical_unity;Pro;hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians are coming to us to work
Historical_unity;Pro;they find a welcome reception and support
Historical_unity;Pro;that what the ”aggressor ​state“ is
Historical_unity;Uni;many people in Russia and Ukraine sincerely believed ​and assumed that our close cultural, spiritual and economic ties would certainly ​last
Historical_unity;Uni;the commonality of our people
Historical_unity;Uni;who had always had a sense ​of unity at their core
Historical_unity;His;Ukraine's ruling circles decided to justify their country's ​independence through the denial of its past
Historical_unity;Del;justify their country's ​independence
Historical_unity;Del;They began to mythologize and rewrite history
Historical_unity;Del;edit out everything that united us
Historical_unity;His;refer to the period when Ukraine was part of the Russian Empire ​and the Soviet Union as an occupation
Historical_unity;Pro;The common tragedy of collectivization ​and famine of the early 1930s was portrayed as the genocide of the Ukrainian ​people
Historical_unity;Pro;We, as the largest trade and economic partner of Ukraine, suggested ​discussing the emerging problems in the Ukraine-Russia-EU format
Historical_unity;Pro;every ​time we were told that Russia had nothing to do with it and that the issue ​concerned only the EU and Ukraine
Historical_unity;Pro;Western countries rejected ​Russia's repeated calls for dialogue
Historical_unity;Del;the concept of ”Ukraine is not ​Russia“
Historical_unity;Pro;a need for the ”anti-Russia“ concept ​which we will never accept
Historical_unity;Pro;there is no need ​to deceive anyone that this is being done in the interests of the people ​of Ukraine
Historical_unity;His;historical Russian ​lands were mercilessly exploited and remained the poorest
Historical_unity;Pro;The Nazis, abetted ​by collaborators from the OUN-UPA, did not need Ukraine, but a living space ​and slaves for Aryan overlords
Historical_unity;Del;Nor were the interests of the Ukrainian people thought of in February 2014
Historical_unity;Pro;legitimate public discontent, caused by acute socio-economic problems, ​mistakes, and inconsistent actions of the authorities of the time, was simply ​cynically exploited
Historical_unity;Uni;the things that united us and bring us together
Historical_unity;Uni;the Russian language
Historical_unity;Uni;the new ”Maidan“ ​authorities first tried to repeal the law on state language policy
Historical_unity;His;this is happening in a country, as I have already noted, that is very complex ​in terms of its territorial, national and linguistic composition, and its history ​of formation
Historical_unity;Uni;if you are talking about a single large nation, a triune ​nation, then what difference does it make who people consider themselves ​to be – Russians, Ukrainians, or Belarusians
Historical_unity;Del;the fact is that the situation in Ukraine today is completely different because ​it involves a forced change of identity
Historical_unity;Del;the Russians in Ukraine are being forced not only to deny their roots, generations ​of their ancestors but also to believe that Russia is their enemy
Historical_unity;Uni;the Russians in Ukraine are being forced not only to deny their roots, generations ​of their ancestors

Historical_unity;Uni;the Ukrainian Orthodox Church while ​maintaining spiritual unity with the Moscow Patriarchate
Historical_unity;His;For the Ukrainians who fought in the Red Army
Historical_unity;His;the Great ​Patriotic War was indeed a patriotic war
Historical_unity;His;they were defending their ​home
Historical_unity;Uni;they were defending their ​home, their great common Motherland
Historical_unity;Pro;The anti-Russia project has been rejected by millions of Ukrainians
Historical_unity;Pro;The people ​of Crimea and residents of Sevastopol made their historic choice

Historical_unity;Pro;Russia has done everything to stop fratricide
Historical_unity;Pro;During official negotiations, especially after being reined in by Western partners, ​Ukraine's representatives regularly declare their ”full adherence“ to the Minsk ​agreements, but are in fact guided by a position of ”unacceptability“
Historical_unity;Pro;Russophobia
Historical_unity;Del;Kiev simply ​does not need Donbas
Historical_unity;Del;the inhabitants of these regions ​will never accept the order that they have tried and are trying to impose by force, ​blockade and threats
Historical_unity;Pro;the outcome of both Minsk-1 and Minsk-2 ​which give a real chance to peacefully restore the territorial integrity of Ukraine ​by coming to an agreement directly with the DPR and LPR with Russia, Germany ​and France as mediators, contradicts the entire logic of the anti-Russia project
Historical_unity;Pro;it can only be sustained by the constant cultivation of the image ​of an internal and external enemy
Historical_unity;Pro;we are facing the creation ​of a climate of fear in Ukrainian society
Historical_unity;Pro;By the way, who will pay these debts back? Apparently, it is assumed that this will ​have to be done not only by today's generation of Ukrainians but also by their ​children, grandchildren and probably great-grandchildren
Historical_unity;Pro;the anti-Russia project
Historical_unity;Del;there is no place either for a sovereign Ukraine ​or for the political forces that are trying to defend its real independence
Historical_unity;Pro;pro-Russian
Historical_unity;Pro;reconciliation in Ukrainian society
Historical_unity;Pro;for many people in Ukraine, the anti-Russia project is simply ​unacceptable
Historical_unity;Pro;they are not allowed ​to raise their heads
Historical_unity;Pro;They are intimidated, driven underground
Historical_unity;Pro;Not only are they persecuted for their convictions, for the spoken word, ​for the open expression of their position, but they are also killed
Historical_unity;Pro;the ”right“ patriot of Ukraine is only the one who hates Russia
Historical_unity;Pro;Hate and anger, as world history has repeatedly ​proved this, are a very shaky foundation for sovereignty, fraught with many ​serious risks and dire consequences
Historical_unity;Pro;All the subterfuges associated with the anti-Russia project are clear to us.
Historical_unity;His;we will never allow our historical territories and people close to us living ​there to be used against Russia
Historical_unity;Pro;to those who will undertake such ​an attempt, I would like to say that this way they will destroy their own country
Historical_unity;Uni;We see them as our own close people.

Historical_unity;Del;true sovereignty of Ukraine is possible only in partnership ​with Russia
Historical_unity;Uni;Our spiritual, human and civilizational ties formed for centuries ​and have their origins in the same sources
Historical_unity;Uni;Our kinship has been transmitted ​from generation to generation
Historical_unity;Uni;It is in the hearts and the memory of people living ​in modern Russia and Ukraine, in the blood ties that unite millions of our ​families

Historical_unity;Uni;For we are one people.
Historical_unity;Pro;these words may be perceived by some people with hostility

Address;Uni;It is an inalienable part of our own history, culture and spiritual space
Address;His;inalienable

Address;Pro;to explain the motives behind Russia’s actions and what we aim to achieve
Address;Del;modern Ukraine was entirely created by Russia
Address;His;that modern Ukraine was entirely created by Russia
Address;His;Lenin and his associates did it ​in a way that was extremely harsh on Russia – by separating, severing what is ​historically Russian land
Address;Pro;Nobody asked the millions of people living there what ​they thought
Address;His;Stalin incorporated ​in the USSR and transferred to Ukraine some lands that previously belonged ​to Poland, Romania and Hungary
Address;His;Khrushchev took ​Crimea away from Russia for some reason and also gave it to Ukraine
Address;His;this is how the territory of modern Ukraine was formed
Address;Del;after the 1917 October Revolution and the subsequent Civil ​War, the Bolsheviks set about creating a new statehood

Address;Del;a confederative state arrangement
Address;Del;the right ​of nations to self-determination
Address;Del;why was ​it necessary to appease the nationalists, to satisfy the ceaselessly growing ​nationalist ambitions on the outskirts of the former empire?
Address;Del;What was the point ​of transferring to the newly, often arbitrarily formed administrative units – ​the union republics – vast territories that had nothing to do with them?
Address;His;these territories were transferred along with the population of what ​was historically Russia
Address;Del;these administrative units were de facto given the status and form ​of national state entities
Address;Del;why was it necessary ​to make such generous gifts, beyond the wildest dreams of the most zealous ​nationalists and, on top of all that, give the republics the right to secede from ​the unified state without any conditions?

Address;Esc;Otherwise, the responsibility for the possible continuation ​of the bloodshed will lie entirely on the conscience of Ukraine’s ruling regime
Address;Esc;I consider it necessary to take a long overdue decision ​and to immediately recognise the independence and sovereignty of the Donetsk ​People's Republic and the Lugansk People's Republic
Address;Pro;Everything was in vain
Address;Esc;those who then ​embarked on the path of violence, bloodshed and lawlessness did not recognise ​then and do not recognise now any solution to the Donbass issue other than ​a military one
Address;Esc;How long can this tragedy continue?
Address;Esc;How much longer can one put up with this?

Address;Pro;it has persistently and patiently pushed for the implementation of UN ​Security Council Resolution
Address;Pro;They are fighting for their ​elementary right to live on their own land, to speak their own language, ​and to preserve their culture and traditions
Address;Pro;Not a single day goes by without Donbass communities coming under shelling ​attacks
Address;Esc;the ruling Kiev elites ​never stop publicly making clear their unwillingness to comply with the Minsk ​Package of Measures to settle the conflict and are not interested in a peaceful ​settlement
Address;Esc;they are trying to orchestrate a blitzkrieg in Donbass ​as was the case in 2014 and 2015
Address;Esc;Russia has every right to respond ​in order to ensure its security. That is exactly what we will do.
Address;His;"When it comes to the historical destiny of Russia and its peoples, Lenin’s ​principles of state development were not just a mistake; they were worse than ​a mistake"
Address;His;we cannot change past events, but we must at least admit them ​openly and honestly, without any reservations or politicking
Address;Del;no political factors, however impressive or profitable they may seem at any ​given moment, can or may be used as the fundamental principles of statehood
Address;Pro;I am not trying to put the blame on anyone
Address;His;It ​is a historical fact
Address;Del;Soviet Ukraine is the result ​of the Bolsheviks’ policy and can be rightfully called “Vladimir Lenin’s Ukraine
Address;His;Donbass, ​which was actually shoved into Ukraine
Address;Esc;We are ready to show what real decommunizations would mean ​for Ukraine
Address;His;the Soviet Union was established ​in the place of the former Russian Empire
Address;Del;it was impossible to preserve or govern such a vast ​and complex territory on the amorphous principles that amounted ​to confederation
Address;His;far removed from reality and the historical tradition
Address;Del;the Red Terror and a rapid slide into Stalin’s dictatorship, ​the domination of the communist ideology and the Communist Party’s monopoly ​on power, nationalisation and the planned economy – all this transformed ​the formally declared but ineffective principles of government into a mere ​declaration
Address;Del;In reality, the union republics did not have any sovereign rights, none ​at all.
Address;His;The practical result was the creation of a tightly centralised and absolutely ​unitary state
Address;Del;the creation of a tightly centralised and absolutely ​unitary state
Address;His;the fundamental and formally legal foundations ​of our state were not promptly cleansed of the odious and utopian fantasies ​inspired by the revolution, which are absolutely destructive for any normal state
Address;Del;the mine was the right of secession from ​the Soviet Union
Address;Del;the Communist ​Party leadership only engaged in open doubletalk about the revival ​of the Leninist principle of national self-determination
Address;Del;in the course of power struggle within the Communist Party itself, each ​of the opposing sides, in a bid to expand its support base, started ​to thoughtlessly incite and encourage nationalist sentiments
Address;Del;The republics of the USSR shall possess all the rights appropriate ​to their status as sovereign socialist states.
Address;Del;The supreme representative bodies of power of the USSR ​republics can challenge and suspend the operation of the USSR Government’s ​resolutions and directives in their territory.
Address;Del;Each republic of the USSR shall have citizenship of its own, which ​shall apply to all of its residents.
Address;Del;why was it necessary to rock the country even more in that already complicated ​situation?
Address;Del;radicals and nationalists, including and primarily ​those in Ukraine, are taking credit for having gained independence
Address;His;The disintegration of our united country was ​brought about by the historic, strategic mistakes on the part of the Bolshevik ​leaders and the CPSU leadership
Address;Pro;Not only did Russia ​recognise these countries, but helped its CIS partners
Address;Pro;This included our Ukrainian colleagues, who turned ​to us for financial support many times from the very moment they declared ​independence
Address;Pro;Our country provided this assistance while respecting Ukraine’s ​dignity and sovereignty
Address;Pro;the subsidised loans Russia provided to Ukraine along with ​economic and trade preferences, the overall benefit for the Ukrainian budget ​in the period from 1991 to 2013 amounted to $250 billion
Address;Pro;Russia undertook to pay back all Soviet debts and delivered on this promise ​by completing this process in 2017
Address;Pro;the newly independent states had to hand over to Russia ​part of the Soviet foreign assets
Address;Pro;despite all these challenges, Russia always worked with Ukraine ​in an open and honest manner and, as I have already said, with respect for its ​interests
Address;Pro;it was striking how the Ukrainian authorities always preferred ​dealing with Russia in a way that ensured that they enjoy all the rights ​and privileges while remaining free from any obligations
Address;Pro;Kiev tried to use dialogue with Russia as a bargaining chip in its ​relations with the West
Address;Uni;the mentality and historical memory of millions of people, ​of entire generations living in Ukraine
Address;Del;Ukraine actually never had stable traditions of real ​statehood
Address;Del;it opted for mindlessly emulating foreign ​models, which have no relation to history or Ukrainian realities
Address;Del;Political ​government institutions were readjusted many times to the rapidly growing clans ​and their self-serving interests, which had nothing to do with the interests ​of the Ukrainian people
Address;Pro;billions of dollars that ​the oligarchs have stolen from the Ukrainians
Address;Pro;Others ​claimed to be in favour of good relations with Russia and cultural and language ​diversity, coming to power with the help of their citizens who sincerely supported ​their declared aspirations, including the millions of people in the south-eastern ​regions
Address;Pro;the public organisations that supported bilingualism and cooperation ​with Russia
Address;Del;the real cultural, economic and social ​interests of the people and Ukraine’s true sovereignty with various ethnic ​speculations and formal ethnic attributes
Address;Del;A stable statehood has never developed in Ukraine
Address;Del;its electoral and other ​political procedures just serve as a cover, a screen for the redistribution of power ​and property between various oligarchic clans
Address;Del;Corruption, which is certainly a challenge and a problem for many countries, ​including Russia, has gone beyond the usual scope in Ukraine. It has literally ​permeated and corroded Ukrainian statehood, the entire system, and all ​branches of power.
Address;Del;Radical nationalists took advantage of the justified public discontent ​and saddled the Maidan protest
Address;Del;a coup d'état in 2014
Address;Pro;But the people who actually suffered, the families of those who died ​in the clashes provoked in the streets and squares of Kiev and other cities, how ​much did they get in the end? Better not ask.
Address;Del;The nationalists who have seized power have unleashed a persecution, a real ​terror campaign against those who opposed their anti-constitutional actions
Address;Esc;we know ​their names and we will do everything to punish them, find them and bring them ​to justice
Address;Del;Maidan did not bring Ukraine any closer to democracy
Address;Del;a coup d'état
Address;Del;the nationalists and those political forces that ​supported them eventually led Ukraine into an impasse
Address;His;They spent ​and embezzled the legacy inherited not only from the Soviet era, but also from ​the Russian Empire
Address;Pro;They lost tens, hundreds of thousands of jobs which ​enabled people to earn a reliable income and generate tax revenue, among other ​things thanks to close cooperation with Russia
Address;Uni;There was a time, however, when not ​only Ukraine, but the entire Soviet Union took pride in these companies
Address;His;In 2021, the Black Sea Shipyard in Nikolayev went out of business. Its first docks ​date back to Catherine the Great.
Address;His;the gas transportation system, it was built in its entirety by the Soviet ​Union
Address;Del;The Kiev authorities, at the West’s ​demand, delegated the priority right to select members of the supreme judicial ​bodies, the Council of Justice and the High Qualifications Commission of Judges, ​to international organisations
Address;Pro;Are the Ukrainian people aware that this is how their country is managed?
Address;Del;Do ​they realise that their country has turned not even into a political or economic ​protectorate but has been reduced to a colony with a puppet regime?
Address;Del;The state ​was privatised.
Address;Del;the government, which designates itself ​as the “power of patriots” no longer acts in a national capacity and consistently ​pushes Ukraine towards losing its sovereignty.
Address;Pro;A few words about Crimea. The people of the peninsula freely made their choice ​to be with Russia.
Address;Del;A few words about Crimea. The people of the peninsula freely made their choice ​to be with Russia. The Kiev authorities cannot challenge the clearly stated choice ​of the people,
Address;Esc;We cannot but ​react to this real danger
Address;His;in the 18th century, ​the lands of the Black Sea littoral, incorporated in Russia as a result of wars with ​the Ottoman Empire, were given the name of Novorossiya (New Russia)
Address;His;attempts are being made to condemn these landmarks of history to oblivion, ​along with the names of state and military figures of the Russian Empire without ​whose efforts modern Ukraine would not have many big cities or even access ​to the Black Sea
Address;Pro;Article 17 of the Constitution of Ukraine stipulates that deploying ​foreign military bases on its territory is illegal.
Address;Pro;International documents expressly stipulate the principle of equal and indivisible ​security, which includes obligations not to strengthen one's own security ​at the expense of the security of other states
Address;Pro;This is stated in the 1999 OSCE ​Charter for European Security adopted in Istanbul and the 2010 OSCE Astana ​Declaration
Address;Pro;Many European allies ​of the United States were well aware of the risks associated with this prospect
Address;Pro;NATO member states are still very sceptical about Ukraine joining ​NATO
Address;Pro;thanks to our ​openness and goodwill, relations between Russia and the West had reached ​a high level
Address;Pro;Russia has fulfilled all of its obligations, including the pullout from Germany, from ​Central and Eastern Europe, making an immense contribution to overcoming ​the legacy of the Cold War
Address;Pro;We have consistently proposed various cooperation ​options, including in the NATO-Russia Council and the OSCE formats
Address;Pro;When then outgoing US President Bill Clinton visited Moscow ​in 2000, I asked him how America would feel about admitting Russia to NATO
Address;Pro;All right, you do ​not want to see us as friends or allies, but why make us an enemy?
Address;Pro;I would like people in Russia ​and Ukraine to understand this
Address;Pro;they simply did not care at all about such things ​and did whatever they deemed necessary
Address;Esc;we do not accept this behaviour and will never accept it
Address;Pro;Russia has always advocated the resolution of the most complicated problems ​by political and diplomatic means, at the negotiating table
Address;Pro;We are well aware of our enormous responsibility when it comes to regional ​and global stability
Address;Pro;our proposal was rejected right off the bat ​on the pretext that Russia should not be allowed to put limits on NATO activities
Address;Pro;, it was made explicitly clear to us that only NATO members can have ​legally binding security guarantees
Address;Pro;we handed over to our Western partners a draft treaty between ​the Russian Federation and the United States of America on security guarantees, ​as well as a draft agreement on measures to ensure the security of the Russian ​Federation and NATO member states
Address;Esc;because we exist and will never ​compromise our sovereignty, national interests or values
Historical_unity;Tvw;The formula they apply has been known from time immemorial – divide ​and rule
Historical_unity;Tvw;The process ​of Polonization and Latinization began, ousting Orthodoxy
Historical_unity;Tvw;part of the western Russian ​Orthodox clergy submitted to the authority of the Pope
Historical_unity;Tvw;the desire of the leaders of the Polish national movement to exploit the ” ​Ukrainian issue“
Historical_unity;Tvw;the idea of Ukrainian people as a nation separate from ​the Russians started to form and gain ground among the Polish elite and a part ​of the Malorussian intelligentsia
Historical_unity;Tvw;conclusions were substantiated by all sorts of concoctions, ​which went as far as to claim that the Ukrainians are the true Slavs
Historical_unity;Tvw;”hypotheses“ became ​increasingly used for political purposes as a tool of rivalry between European ​states
Historical_unity;Tvw;Austro-Hungarian authorities had latched onto ​this narrative, using it as a counterbalance to the Polish national movement ​and pro-Muscovite sentiments in Galicia.
Historical_unity;Tvw;foreign intervention.
Historical_unity;Tvw;Germany and Austria-Hungary were at the time in a dire situation and needed Ukrainian bread and raw ​materials
Historical_unity;Tvw;pretext for occupation
Historical_unity;Tvw;those who have today given up the full control of Ukraine to external forces
Historical_unity;Tvw;the Polish government pursued ​an active resettlement policy, seeking to change the ethnic composition ​of the Eastern Borderlands
Historical_unity;Tvw;external ”patrons“
Historical_unity;Tvw;abroad
Historical_unity;Tvw;kept their stolen money in Western banks
Historical_unity;Tvw;persistent weakness of state institutions and the position ​of a willing hostage to someone else's geopolitical will
Historical_unity;Tvw;the U.S. and EU countries systematically ​and consistently pushed Ukraine to curtail and limit economic cooperation with ​Russia
Historical_unity;Tvw;Western countries
Historical_unity;Tvw;Western countries directly interfered in Ukraine's internal ​affairs and supported the coup
Historical_unity;Tvw;after being reined in by Western partners, ​Ukraine's representatives regularly declare their ”full adherence“ to the Minsk ​agreements, but are in fact guided by a position of ”unacceptability“.
Historical_unity;Tvw;they attract the attention of external patrons ​and masters by all means
Historical_unity;Tvw;with Russia, Germany ​and France as mediators
Historical_unity;Tvw;under the protection ​and control of the Western powers
Historical_unity;Tvw;we are witnessing not just complete ​dependence but direct external control
Historical_unity;Tvw;the supervision ​of the Ukrainian authorities, security services and armed forces by foreign ​advisers, military ”development“ of the territory of Ukraine and deployment ​of NATO infrastructure
Historical_unity;Tvw;This is also a disguise for the takeover of the rest of the Ukrainian economy ​and the exploitation of its natural resources
Historical_unity;Tvw;The sale of agricultural land is not ​far off, and it is obvious who will buy it up
Historical_unity;Tvw;with preferences and benefits for Western companies
Historical_unity;Tvw;The Western authors of the anti-Russia project set up the Ukrainian political ​system in such a way that presidents, members of parliament and ministers ​would change but the attitude of separation from and enmity with Russia would ​remain
Historical_unity;Tvw;The incumbent authorities in Ukraine like to refer to Western experience, seeing ​it as a model to follow
Historical_unity;Tvw;it is important for us to understand that our partner is defending its ​national interests but not serving someone else's
Historical_unity;Tvw;is not a tool in someone ​else's hands to fight against us
Address;Tvw;the so-called civilised world, which our Western colleagues ​proclaimed themselves the only representatives of, prefers not to see this, as if ​this horror and genocide, which almost 4 million people are facing, do not exist
Address;Tvw;supported coup in Ukraine in 2014
Address;Tvw;using the threat of closer ties with Russia ​for blackmailing the West to secure preferences by claiming that otherwise ​Russia would have a bigger influence in Ukraine
Address;Tvw;A role in this was played by external forces
Address;Tvw;a ramified network ​of NGOs and special services to nurture their clients in Ukraine and to bring their ​representatives to the seats of authority
Address;Tvw;the so-called pro-Western civilisational choice made by the oligarchic ​Ukrainian authorities
Address;Tvw;billions of dollars that ​the oligarchs have stolen from the Ukrainians and are holding in their accounts ​in Western banks,
Address;Tvw;They also ​had direct assistance from foreign states
Address;Tvw;the US Embassy ​provided $1 million a day to support the so-called protest camp ​on Independence Square in Kiev
Address;Tvw;is this the pro-Western civilisational choice they ​have been using for many years to fool millions of people with promises ​of heavenly pastures?
Address;Tvw;Ukraine itself was placed under external control,
Address;Tvw;directed not only from the Western capitals, but also on the ground, as the saying ​goes, through an entire network of foreign advisors, NGOs and other institutions ​present in Ukraine
Address;Tvw;the United States directly controls the National Agency on Corruption ​Prevention, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau, the Specialised Anti-Corruption ​Prosecutor's Office and the High Anti-Corruption Court
Address;Tvw;We have factual proof that such aggressive actions are being ​taken with support from Western security services.
Address;Tvw;with the assistance ​of the international community on favourable terms for Ukraine
Address;Tvw;with foreign military support in the geopolitical ​confrontation with the Russian Federation
Address;Tvw;especially if Kiev receives foreign technological ​support
Address;Tvw;Ukraine’s Western ​patrons may help it acquire these weapons to create yet another threat to our ​country
Address;Tvw;Since 2014, the United States alone has spent billions of dollars for this ​purpose, including supplies of arms and equipment and training of specialists
Address;Tvw;there has been a constant flow of Western weapons ​to Ukraine
Address;Tvw;Foreign advisors ​supervise the activities of Ukraine’s armed forces and special services
Address;Tvw;military contingents of NATO countries have been almost ​constantly present on Ukrainian territory under the pretext of exercises
Address;Tvw;The Ukrainian troop control system has already been integrated into NATO
Address;Tvw;NATO headquarters can issue direct commands to the Ukrainian ​armed forces, even to their separate units and squads
Address;Tvw;The United States and NATO have started an impudent development of Ukrainian ​territory as a theatre of potential military operations
Address;Tvw;Their regular joint exercises ​are obviously anti-Russian
Address;Tvw;such undertakings are designed to be a cover-up for a rapid buildup ​of the NATO military group on Ukrainian territory
Address;Tvw;the network of airfields upgraded with US help in Borispol, Ivano-Frankovsk, ​Chuguyev and Odessa, to name a few, is capable of transferring army units ​in a very short time
Address;Tvw;Ukraine’s airspace is open to flights by US strategic ​and reconnaissance aircraft and drones that conduct surveillance over Russian ​territory
Address;Tvw;the US-built Maritime Operations Centre in Ochakov makes it ​possible to support activity by NATO warships, including the use of precision ​weapons, against the Russian Black Sea Fleet and our infrastructure ​on the entire Black Sea Coast
Address;Tvw;the United States intended to build similar facilities in Crimea ​as well but the Crimeans and residents of Sevastopol wrecked these plans
Address;Tvw;Ukraine is home to NATO training missions which are, in fact, foreign military ​bases
Address;Tvw;Kiev has long proclaimed a strategic course on joining NATO
Address;Tvw;Ukraine joining NATO is a direct threat ​to Russia's security
Address;Tvw;at the Bucharest NATO summit held in April 2008, ​the United States pushed through a decision to the effect that Ukraine and, ​by the way, Georgia would become NATO members
Address;Tvw;The Americans simply used them to carry out a clearly anti-Russian policy
Address;Tvw;they are trying to convince us over and over again that NATO is ​a peace-loving and purely defensive alliance that poses no threat to Russia
Address;Tvw;when German unification was discussed, ​the United States promised the Soviet leadership that NATO jurisdiction ​or military presence will not expand one inch to the east and that the unification ​of Germany will not lead to the spread of NATO's military organisation to the east.
Address;Tvw;The governments of certain Eastern ​European countries, speculating on Russophobia, brought their complexes ​and stereotypes about the Russian threat to the Alliance and insisted on building ​up the collective defence potentials and deploying them primarily against Russia
Address;Tvw;NATO’s ​continued expansion
Address;Tvw;overt support for terrorists in the North ​Caucasus
Address;Tvw;They just do not need a big and independent country like Russia ​around
Address;Tvw;one glance at the map is enough to see to what extent Western countries ​have kept their promise to refrain from NATO’s eastward expansion
Address;Tvw;"five waves of NATO expansion, one after another – ​Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary were admitted in 1999; Bulgaria, ​Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia in 2004; Albania ​and Croatia in 2009; Montenegro in 2017; and North Macedonia in 2020"

Address;Tvw;to prevent further NATO expansion
Address;Tvw;to have the Alliance ​refrain from deploying assault weapon systems on Russian borders
Address;Tvw;rolling back the bloc's military capability and infrastructure in Europe to where ​they were in 1997, when the NATO-Russia Founding Act was signed
Historical_unity;Tcs;But these are also the result ​of deliberate efforts by those forces that have always sought to undermine our ​unity
Historical_unity;Tcs;if they brought about ​the weakening of Russia, our ill-wishes are happy with that
Historical_unity;Tcs;high-tech industrial giants that were once the pride of Ukraine ​and the entire Union, are sinking
Historical_unity;Tcs;The scale of deindustrialization and overall economic degradation ​is visible in Ukraine's electricity production
Historical_unity;Tcs;Ukraine's GDP per capita had been below ​USD 4 thousand
Historical_unity;Tcs;It was ​the Ukrainian authorities who waisted and frittered away the achievements ​of many generations

Historical_unity;Tcs;ready to sell their motherland for the sake of preserving their capital
Historical_unity;Tcs;Ukraine was dragged into a dangerous geopolitical game aimed ​at turning Ukraine into a barrier between Europe and Russia
Historical_unity;Tcs;against Russia
Historical_unity;Tcs;there came a time when the concept of ”Ukraine is not ​Russia“ was no longer an option
Historical_unity;Tcs;anti-Russia
Historical_unity;Tcs;groundwork of the Polish-Austrian ideologists to create an ”anti-Moscow Russia“
Historical_unity;Tcs;Radical nationalist groups served as its battering ​ram
Historical_unity;Tcs;Their slogans, ideology, and blatant aggressive Russophobia have to a large ​extent become defining elements of state policy in Ukraine
Historical_unity;Tcs;All the things that united us and bring us together so far came under attack
Historical_unity;Tcs;the law on the ”purification of power“, the law on education that virtually cut ​the Russian language out of the educational process
Historical_unity;Tcs;New seeds of discord have been sown
Historical_unity;Tcs;the fact is that the situation in Ukraine today is completely different because ​it involves a forced change of identity
Historical_unity;Tcs;aggressive towards Russia
Historical_unity;Tcs;comparable ​in its consequences to the use of weapons of mass destruction against us
Historical_unity;Tcs;the Russian people in all may decrease by hundreds of thousands or even ​millions
Historical_unity;Tcs;Our spiritual unity has also been attacked
Historical_unity;Tcs;The secular authorities, ​making no secret of their political aims, have blatantly interfered in church life ​and brought things to a split, to the seizure of churches
Historical_unity;Tcs;extensive autonomy of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church while ​maintaining spiritual unity with the Moscow Patriarchate strongly displeases ​them
Historical_unity;Tcs;They have to destroy this prominent and centuries-old symbol of our ​kinship at all costs
Historical_unity;Tcs;the representatives of Ukraine over and over again ​vote against the UN General Assembly resolution condemning the glorification ​of Nazism
Historical_unity;Tcs;Marches and torchlit processions in honor of remaining war criminals ​from the SS units take place under the protection of the official authorities
Historical_unity;Tcs;Mazepa, who betrayed everyone, Petliura, who paid for Polish patronage with ​Ukrainian lands, and Bandera, who collaborated with the Nazis, are ranked ​as national heroes.
Historical_unity;Tcs;Everything is being done to erase from the memory of young ​generations the names of genuine patriots and victors, who have always been ​the pride of Ukraine
Historical_unity;Tcs;Ukrainian neo-Nazis burned people alive
Historical_unity;Tcs;The coup d'état and the subsequent actions of the Kiev authorities inevitably ​provoked confrontation and civil war
Historical_unity;Tcs;Russophobia
Historical_unity;Tcs;it can only be sustained by the constant cultivation of the image ​of an internal and external enemy
Historical_unity;Tcs;we are facing the creation ​of a climate of fear in Ukrainian society, aggressive rhetoric, indulging neo-Nazis ​and militarising the country

Address;Tcs;The virus of nationalist ambitions is still with us
Address;Tcs;the mine ​laid at the initial stage to destroy state immunity to the disease of nationalism ​was ticking
Address;Tcs;the increasing socioeconomic problems and the apparent ​crisis of the planned economy aggravated the ethnic issue, which essentially was ​not based on any expectations or unfulfilled dreams of the Soviet peoples but ​primarily the growing appetites of the local elites

Address;Tcs;Kiev tried to use dialogue with Russia as a bargaining chip in its ​relations with the West, using the threat of closer ties with Russia ​for blackmailing the West to secure preferences by claiming that otherwise ​Russia would have a bigger influence in Ukraine
Address;Tcs;Ukrainian authorities – I would like to emphasise this – ​began by building their statehood on the negation of everything that united us, ​trying to distort the mentality and historical memory of millions of people, ​of entire generations living in Ukraine
Address;Tcs;Ukrainian society ​was faced with the rise of far-right nationalism, which rapidly developed into ​aggressive Russophobia and neo-Nazism
Address;Tcs;the participation ​of Ukrainian nationalists and neo-Nazis in the terrorist groups in the North ​Caucasus and the increasingly loud territorial claims to Russia
Address;Tcs;while reverently accommodating the geopolitical rivals ​of Russia
Address;Tcs;these people immediately ​betrayed their voters, going back on their election promises and instead steering ​a policy prompted by the radicals and sometimes even persecuting their former ​allies
Address;Tcs;These people took advantage of the fact that their voters were ​mostly law-abiding citizens with moderate views who trusted the authorities, ​and that, unlike the radicals, they would not act aggressively or make use ​of illegal instruments
Address;Tcs;the radicals became increasingly brazen in their actions and made ​more demands every year
Address;Tcs;infected with the virus of nationalism and corruption
Address;Tcs;Corruption, which is certainly a challenge and a problem for many countries, ​including Russia, has gone beyond the usual scope in Ukraine
Address;Tcs;a real ​terror campaign against those who opposed their anti-constitutional actions.
Address;Tcs;Politicians, journalists, and public activists were harassed and publicly ​humiliated
Address;Tcs;A wave of violence swept Ukrainian cities
Address;Tcs;One shudders at the memories of the terrible ​tragedy in Odessa, where peaceful protesters were brutally murdered, burned ​alive in the House of Trade Unions
Address;Tcs;The criminals who committed that atrocity ​have never been punished, and no one is even looking for them
Address;Tcs;pushed the country into ​the abyss of civil war.
Address;Tcs;the country is split
Address;Tcs;Ukraine is struggling ​with an acute socioeconomic crisis
Address;Tcs;Antonov, the famous manufacturer, has not ​made a single commercial aircraft since 2016, while Yuzhmash, a factory ​specialising in missile and space equipment, is nearly bankrupt.
Address;Tcs;There is no independent judiciary in Ukraine
Address;Tcs;The policy to root out the Russian language and culture and promote ​assimilation carries on.
Address;Tcs;People who identify as Russians and want to preserve ​their identity, language and culture are getting the signal that they are not ​wanted in Ukraine.
Address;Tcs;Under the laws on education and the Ukrainian language as a state language, ​the Russian language has no place in schools or public spaces, even in ordinary ​shops.
Address;Tcs;There are more and more acts enabling the Ukrainian military and law ​enforcement agencies to crack down on the freedom of speech, dissent, ​and going after the opposition.
Address;Tcs;Ukraine has outperformed its Western masters ​by inventing sanctions against its own citizens, companies, television channels, ​other media outlets and even members of parliament.
Address;Tcs;Kiev continues to prepare the destruction of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church ​of the Moscow Patriarchate
Address;Tcs;The Ukrainian authorities have ​cynically turned the tragedy of the schism into an instrument of state policy.
Address;Tcs;The current authorities do not react to the Ukrainian people’s appeals to abolish ​the laws that are infringing on believers’ rights.
Address;Tcs;new draft laws directed ​against the clergy and millions of parishioners of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church ​of the Moscow Patriarchate have been registered in the Verkhovna Rada.
Address;Tcs;which is why they have opted for aggressive action
Address;Tcs;, for activating ​extremist cells, including radical Islamist organisations, for sending subversives ​to stage terrorist attacks at critical infrastructure facilities, and for kidnapping ​Russian citizens
Address;Tcs;a new Military Strategy was adopted in Ukraine. This document is ​almost entirely dedicated to confrontation with Russia and sets the goal ​of involving foreign states in a conflict with our country
Address;Tcs;It also sets out the contours of a potential ​war
Address;Tcs;this is nothing other than ​preparation for hostilities against our country, Russia
Address;Tcs;Ukraine intends to create its ​own nuclear weapons
Address;Tcs;acquiring tactical nuclear weapons will be much easier ​for Ukraine than for some other states
Address;Tcs;If Ukraine acquires weapons of mass destruction, the situation in the world ​and in Europe will drastically change, especially for us, for Russia
Address;Tcs;We are seeing how persistently the Kiev regime is being pumped with ​arms
Address;Tcs;Ukraine joining NATO is a direct threat ​to Russia's security
Address;Tcs;military infrastructure has reached Russia’s borders
Address;Tcs;The situation continues to deteriorate, including in the strategic area
Address;Tcs;positioning areas for interceptor missiles are being established in Romania ​and Poland as part of the US project to create a global missile defence system
Address;Tcs;the launchers deployed there can be used ​for Tomahawk cruise missiles – offensive strike systems
Address;Tcs;the United States is developing its all-purpose Standard Missile-6, ​which can provide air and missile defence, as well as strike ground and surface ​targets
Address;Tcs;the level of military threats to Russia will increase ​dramatically
Address;Tcs;the risk of a sudden strike at our country will multiply
Address;Tcs;American strategic planning documents confirm the possibility ​of a so-called preemptive strike at enemy missile systems
Address;Tcs;We also know ​the main adversary of the United States and NATO. It is Russia.
Address;Tcs;NATO documents ​officially declare our country to be the main threat to Euro-Atlantic security
Address;Tcs;Ukraine will serve as an advanced bridgehead for such a strike
Address;Tcs;Ukrainian airfields are located not far from our borders
Address;Tcs;NATO’s tactical ​aviation deployed there, including precision weapon carriers, will be capable ​of striking at our territory to the depth of the Volgograd-Kazan-Samara-Astrakhan ​line
Address;Tcs;The deployment of reconnaissance radars on Ukrainian territory will allow ​NATO to tightly control Russia’s airspace up to the Urals
Address;Tcs;after the US destroyed the INF Treaty, the Pentagon has been openly ​developing many land-based attack weapons, including ballistic missiles that are ​capable of hitting targets at a distance of up to 5,500 km
Address;Tcs;If deployed in Ukraine, ​such systems will be able to hit targets in Russia’s entire European part
Address;Tcs;The flying time of Tomahawk cruise missiles to Moscow will be less than 35 ​minutes
Address;Tcs;ballistic missiles from Kharkov will take seven to eight minutes
Address;Tcs;hypersonic assault weapons, four to five minutes
Address;Tcs;It is like a knife ​to the throat.
Address;Tcs;they ​are again trying to blackmail us and are threatening us with sanctions,
Address;Tcs;they will never think twice ​before coming up with or just fabricating a pretext for yet another sanction attack ​regardless of the developments in Ukraine
Address;Tcs;Their one and only goal is to hold ​back the development of Russia
